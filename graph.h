 For each questions, unit test would be appreciated. No hard deadline but please send it within the next week. Code must be given in a public git repository. This test can be relatively long and we don't want to take too much of your time so please don't put more than 4 or 5 hours on it. It's ok to not answer every questions.
 
1. Create a C++ class for representing a directed graph with the following properties:
- each node is represented by a non-negative integer
- each directed edge has an integer weight in the range -100..100
- for each directed edge a â†’ b, the difference between a and b is in the range -32000..32000
- loops (an edge from a node to itself) and parallel edges (multiple edges from the same two nodes) are allowed

The class must follow this api:
